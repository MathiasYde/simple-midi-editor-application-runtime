# SMEAR

## ___Simple MIDI Editing Application Runtime (a [Newt](https://github.com/Zaeiro/Newt) application)___

## Features

### Only use what you need

SMEAR is designed to be modular and each module has a single concern - only what you need is loaded.

## Why?

I had a need for a program that could synthesize MIDI input from my MIDI keyboard controller, but nothing quite provided me with the features that I needed. Therefore, this project. It aims to be simple, modular and user-friendly.

## Why you shouldn't use this program

This is a personal project, purely motivated by the thrill of a programming challenge and fun of it. My contributions to this project will decay as soon as this motivation fades away, meaning that updates are sparse.

People are welcome to contribute, but I'd be surprised if anyone other than me would ever use this.

## Special thanks

### [Newt](https://github.com/Zaeiro/Newt)

Specials thanks for my great friend Zaeiro for making an application framework that I could use for this project.
